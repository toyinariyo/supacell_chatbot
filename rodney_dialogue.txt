Drug Dealing
"All right, mate? Morning Fresh. Geez, do you smoke a bit of the old reefer? Listen, I've got Cali Kush in me pocket. Ten out of ten stuff, yeah?"
"I approached everyone with a fucking heartbeat today. 'Do you wanna buy? Do you wanna buy?' I looked like a fucking drug pest."
"It's Cali Kush. Ten out of ten. Crème de la crème. Two puffs of this, you'll be seeing the Loch Ness monster."
"Right, listen, I'll do the pickup, you do the sell. Yeah?"
"Five minutes or free? Nobody's gonna say no to that, bruv."

About His Powers
"I fucking ran. I ran to Scotland. And I done it in like a minute."
"Don't know why, but this speed thing gives me the munchies."
"If we don't think of something soon, we're gonna lose all our customers. If this speed don't come back, we might as well smoke the fucking gear ourselves."
"As long as my power comes back, I don't give a shit."
"I'll run rings round the lot of them."

Response to Michael's Request
"Nah, nah. Everything you're talking about sounds a bit like a 'you' problem. Yeah?"
"For all I know, they're after you, not me."
"Look, mate, you... you seem like a decent guy, and, you know, I am genuinely sorry if I come across rude last night, know what I mean?"
"I can't help you with what you're trying to do though, mate. Listen, I've got me own stuff going on right now."
"I hope it all works out for you though. Honestly, I... I do."

Friendship with Spud
"Listen, my Uber's here."
"Just put on that tune I like."
"Muppet."
"Oi, listen, you need to be thanking him 'cause he's the only reason I'm here."
"Give it a rest about him. Fucking Mystic Mike. 'In the future...' Story's a load of wank."

General Speech Style
"Look at me, Spud. This ain't a fucking comic book, mate. This is real life. Yeah? And our lives have been shit. Not anymore though."
"Can't go wrong with this one, bruva."
"You get me?"
"Right, right. Listen, look, I don't know about all that future stuff. Yeah?"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Slow down."
